Here’s a classic brownie recipe that yields rich and fudgy brownies:
### Ingredients:
- 1 cup (225g) unsalted butter
- 1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
- 1 cup (200g) brown sugar, packed 4 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour
- 1 cup (85g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
-1 cup (175g) chocolate chips or chunks (optional)
### Instructions:
1. **Preheat Oven**:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.
2. **Melt Butter**:
In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
3. **Mix Sugars and Eggs**:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the granulated sugar and brown sugar. Add the melted butter to the sugars and mix well. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
4. **Combine Dry Ingredients**:
In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
5. **Add Chocolate Chips**:
Fold in the chocolate chips or chunks if using.
6. **Bake**:
Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).
7. **Cool and Serve**:
Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares and serving.

Rajasthan poll promise: BJP will allow child marriage if elected
By Team-KB December 2, 2018","BJP candidate promises CHILD MARRIAGE if voted to power ? Is this what their thirst for power has come down to ?
Child Marriages in Rajasthan - Representation Image
The campaigning for elections couldn’t get worse. The leaders all over are trying bizarre ways to woo the locals!
Over the recent years, we have seen and heard candidates, union ministers and other officials in power luring the voters with freebees or making poll promises which are not just impossible to deliver. But this time it has gone just too far with statements uttered that are strictly against the law of the land.
In an outrageous incident, a BJP candidate from Rajasthan has openly promised to support ‘Child Marriages’ in her constituency, if voted to power. It may be shocking for most of us reading this, but Shobha Chauhan, who is contesting from the Sojat reserved seat on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket, has promised that she will ensure that the police does not interfere in child marriages if she wins.
Shobha, is the wife of IAS officer Rajesh Chauhan, who is contesting for a second time. While campaigning, when she announced that once she is in power, the people of the area won’t face any harassment from the police over child marriage cases, the audience even applauded the BJP candidate’s shocking poll promise. Isn’t this encouraging and almost legally securing the misguided voters against the law?
The matter has been raised with the District collector of Pali, Sudhir Kumar Sharma. He has taken cognisance of the video in which Shobha is heard making the shocking promise to statement to the voters. The election commission officer of the district said the matter is being investigated and an action will be taken if the video is found to be genuine.
Child marriage is a big problem in Rajasthan but political leaders are clearly supporting the social evil for political gains. It remains to be seen how the saffron party will respond to the irresponsible statement from one of its candidates. Rajasthan has recorded a 20% reduction in child marriages over the years, but it still ranks among the the top 12 states where prevalence of child marriages is extremely high according to a report by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) in 2018.
While the election officials are investigating the matter, it will be interesting to note BJP’s official stand on this matter. Since this is a criminal offence, shouldn’t the said leader be arrested and her candidature cancelled by the EC? Will the Women and Child Welfare Ministry Union Minister, Maneka Gandhi, take a stern action on Chauhan?

Shobha Chauhan – BJP Candidate
Further, the party who is currently ruling Rajasthan must necessarily strictly clarify their stance on allowing and backing the most regressive practice of ‘Child Marriages’ in the entire state.
This is not the first outlandish statement from a BJP Leader in Rajasthan. On Tuesday, while campaigning in Malakheda of Alwar district of Rajasthan, the UP CM said that Hanuman was a forest dweller, deprived and a Dalit. Adding further, he said that Bajrang Bali worked to connect all Indian communities together, from north to south and east to west.",1,"This image features a headline claiming that the BJP in Rajasthan made a poll promise to allow child marriage if elected.
